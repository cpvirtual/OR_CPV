Replacement cab for the Sentinel Diesel Shunter.
By Pierre Gauriat.
Sentinel modifications by Ian Macmillan, who is to be blamed if you don't like it.

This cab was made by Pierre Gauriat for the French Y8000 loco but is a close resemblance to the Sentinel cab. It may also be suitable for other small shunters. It is certainly better than the GP38 cab!

Pierre has kindly allowed me to use it to improve the loco.

Version 3  adds a night and rear cab for use with the MSTS Bin 1.6 upgrade available from http://mstsbin.uktrainsim.com/
The loco will work without the MSTSbin upgrade but the night and rear cabs will not be available.

This patch will automaticaly switch between night and day cabs at sunset and sunrise and in tunnels.
By pressing Key 1 twice you can switch to the rear cab and drive from it with fully working controls.

The right hand cabview has been replaced with a forward view on the right hand side - useful for shunting.

A modified cvf is also included for the Class 14.

INSTALATION.
------------

Unzip to a temporary folder and copy, drag or move the Common.cab folder to your trainset folder.
Open the common.cab/Sentinel folder and you will find a folder called Cabview. Copy the Sentinel.cvf to the loco Cabview folder and overwrite the existing file.

For a correctly positioned headout view copy this line into the .eng file after the Cabview line....

HeadOut ( -1.368 2.75 -0.55 )

You can also add a headout view to the class 14 with this line......

HeadOut ( -1.35 3.2 -1.35 )


My thanks to Pierre Gauriat for the cab and Carlos Gomes for the loco.
