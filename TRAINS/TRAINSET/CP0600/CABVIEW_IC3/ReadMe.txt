	1. About the Cab

	This cabview is made for the danish IC3 diesel multiple unit (dmu).
	The cab is based on photographs about real cab, but it is not 100%
	accurate.

	The IC3 train created by Thomas Hupfeldt and Peter Frost can be
	downloaded from www.train-sim.dk.


	2. Installing
	
		a) Remove the original CABVIEW directories from .../TRAINS/TRAINSET/DSB Mfa
		   and .../TRAINS/TRAINSET/DSB Mfb directories. Extract the new 
		   CABVIEW directory from this package in both directories.

		b) Replace the original mfa.eng and mfb.eng files in 
		   .../TRAINS/TRAINSET/DSB Mfa and .../TRAINS/TRAINSET/DSB Mfb directories 		   with the new ones in this package.

	If you want to put this cab in a MSTS site, please ask me first. You may
  	only distribute the cab in its original form this file included. You may
